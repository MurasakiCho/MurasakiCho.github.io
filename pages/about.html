          Hi, I'm Briana! I'm a full stack software developer based in Atlanta, GA. 
          
          <br><br>
  
          I've stayed in Acworth, GA for the majority of my life. I grew up with technology, mostly with video
          games. I spent many childhood days playing games on a Nintendo or PC. My father is my biggest 
          inspiration for getting into technology. He was a passionate software developer and now a systems 
          administrator. I also made friends with similar interests throughout my life, and so when I graduated
          high school, I went directly into Kennesaw State University (KSU) for a Computer Engineering degree. My time in computer engineering was a 
          great experience as I was able to apply my problem solving skills with hands-on computer building, but i was not sure 
          it was the right path in technology for me, so I decided to take a hiatus from college and work on my skills at home
          while working part-time jobs.
          
          <br> <br>
  
          In 2021, I decided to go back to school for a Computer Science degree. I began my programming journey with Java. I got to know
          the syntax of the language while understanding object-oriented programming. I practiced data structures and understood algorithm analyses
          through Java as well. Eventually I moved into other branches of computer science, such as operating systems, computer networking, 
          database management systems, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and even mobile software development in Android Studio. At the
          end of my senior year, I was involved with a team of other students to develop a mobile budgetting app for our senior project. I was
          the front-end developer and implemented a user-interface for mobile devices using React Native. I gained a lot of experience with
          using JavaScript/TypeScript along with React Native components to develop a user-interface for iOS and Android devices. I also got 
          experience with integrating APIs such as Firebase Authentication, Plaid, and ChatGPT. 

          I graduated in May 2024 and discovered FastTrack a few months after. FastTrack had opportunities in full stack development 
          that I was interested in, so I applied, was accepted into the program, and am currently continuing my programming journey through it!
